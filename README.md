# mdevctl - a mediated device management utility for Linux

## Description

mdevctl is a utility for managing and persisting devices in the
mediated device device framework of the Linux kernel.  Mediated
devices are sub-devices of a parent device (ex. a vGPU) which
can be dynamically created and potentially used by drivers like
vfio-mdev for assignment to virtual machines.

## Installation

On RPM based systems, `make rpm` then install the resulting package.
Otherwise, `make install`

## Architecture

mdevctl stores defined mediated devices in /etc/mdevctl.d/ with
directories matching the parent device name and config files named
by the UUID of the mdev device itself.  The format used is JSON; a
configuration file for an mdev device looks like follows:

```
  {
   "mdev_type": "$VENDOR_TYPE",
   "start": "auto|manual",
   "attrs": [
    ...optional list of device-specific attributes...
   ]
  }
```

When a known parent device add udev event occurs (or, for more recent
kernels, change events with MDEV_STATE values), mdevctl is called by
a udev rule to create defined devices with "start": "auto" configured.

mdevctl defines three classes of commands, those that manage device
config files, those that manage the device itself, and listing
commands for showing defined, active, or potential mdev devices.

Starting with the latter, mdevctl is able to manage mdev devices
created either with mdevctl or externally, such as through direct
sysfs interactions.  Likewise, when generating a list of currently
active mdev devices via the `list` command, all mdevs are included.
When provided with the `--defined` option, the list command will show
mdev device configs defined on the system, regardless of whether they
are currently active.  The `types` command provides details of the
mdev types supported on the system, including the number of
instances of each that may be created, the API exposed for each, as
well as vendor provided name and description as available.

Mediated device definitions can be created with the `define` command,
which not only accepts a fully specified configuration via options,
but can also create a config for a currently running mdev.  Thus a
transient device created either through mdevctl or sysfs can be
promoted to a defined device.  The `undefine` command simply removes
the config definition without modifying the running device, while
the `modify` command allows device config to be modified.  Config
modifications to a running device to not take effect until the device
is stopped and restarted.

This leads to the final class of commands, which provides the `start`
and `stop` functionality.  The start command can operate either on
a previously defined mdev or the mdev can be fully specified via
options to create a transient device, ie. a running device with no
persistence.

Modify a defined device from automatic start to manual:

```
# mdevctl modify --uuid 83c32df7-d52e-4ec1-9668-1f3c7e4df107 --manual
# mdevctl list -d
83c32df7-d52e-4ec1-9668-1f3c7e4df107 0000:00:02.0 i915-GVTg_V4_8 manual

```

Stop a running mdev device:

```
# mdevctl stop -u 83c32df7-d52e-4ec1-9668-1f3c7e4df107
```

Start an mdev device that is not defined

```
# uuidgen
6eba5b41-176e-40db-b93e-7f18e04e0b93
# mdevctl start -u 6eba5b41-176e-40db-b93e-7f18e04e0b93 -p 0000:00:02.0 --type i915-GVTg_V4_1

```

## Advanced usage (attributes and JSON)

mdevctl provides support for specifying additional configuration via
device-specific attributes. It also provides support for inspecting
and modifying its internal JSON representation of the configuration
directly.

Example:

```
# mdevctl list -d
783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf matrix vfio_ap-passthrough manual
```

Add some attributes:

```
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --addattr=assign_adapter --value=5
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --addattr=assign_adapter --value=6
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --addattr=assign_domain --value=0xab
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --addattr=assign_control_domain --value=0xab
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --addattr=assign_domain --value=4
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --addattr=assign_control_domain --value=4
# mdevctl list -dv
783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf matrix vfio_ap-passthrough manual
  Attrs:
    @{0}: {"assign_adapter":"5"}
    @{1}: {"assign_adapter":"6"}
    @{2}: {"assign_domain":"0xab"}
    @{3}: {"assign_control_domain":"0xab"}
    @{4}: {"assign_domain":"4"}
    @{5}: {"assign_control_domain":"4"}
```

Dump the JSON configuration:

```
# mdevctl list -d -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --dumpjson
{
  "mdev_type": "vfio_ap-passthrough",
  "start": "manual",
  "attrs": [
    {
      "assign_adapter": "5"
    },
    {
      "assign_adapter": "6"
    },
    {
      "assign_domain": "0xab"
    },
    {
      "assign_control_domain": "0xab"
    },
    {
      "assign_domain": "4"
    },
    {
      "assign_control_domain": "4"
    }
  ]
}
```

Remove some attributes:

```
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --delattr --index=5
# mdevctl modify -u 783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf --delattr --index=4
# mdevctl list -dv
783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf matrix vfio_ap-passthrough manual
  Attrs:
    @{0}: {"assign_adapter":"5"}
    @{1}: {"assign_adapter":"6"}
    @{2}: {"assign_domain":"0xab"}
    @{3}: {"assign_control_domain":"0xab"}
```

Define an mdev device from a file:

```
# cat vfio_ap_device.json
{
  "mdev_type": "vfio_ap-passthrough",
  "start": "manual",
  "attrs": [
    {
      "assign_adapter": "5"
    },
    {
      "assign_domain": "0x47"
    },
    {
      "assign_domain": "0xff"
    }
  ]
}
# mdevctl define -p matrix --jsonfile vfio_ap_device.json
e2e73122-cc39-40ee-89eb-b0a47d334cae
# mdevctl list -dv
783e6dbb-ea0e-411f-94e2-717eaad438bf matrix vfio_ap-passthrough manual
  Attrs:
    @{0}: {"assign_adapter":"5"}
    @{1}: {"assign_adapter":"6"}
    @{2}: {"assign_domain":"0xab"}
    @{3}: {"assign_control_domain":"0xab"}
e2e73122-cc39-40ee-89eb-b0a47d334cae matrix vfio_ap-passthrough manual
  Attrs:
    @{0}: {"assign_adapter":"5"}
    @{1}: {"assign_domain":"0x47"}
    @{2}: {"assign_domain":"0xff"}
```

# Invoking External Scripts for Device Events

Certain mediated devices may require additional operations or functionality,
such as configuration checking or event reporting, before or after mdevctl
executes a command. In order to remain device-type agnostic, mdevctl will
"call-out" to external scripts to handle the extraneous work. These scripts
are associated with a specific device type to perform any operations or
additional functionality not handled within mdevctl. Additionally, external
programs may wish to receive notifications of any action performed by mdevctl
to e.g. respond to any device changes or keep device management in parallel.

A call-out script is invoked at various points during an mdevctl command
process and are categorized by an "event" paired with an "action", along
with information regarding the mediated device. Two main event types are
"pre" and "post", which are invoked before and after primary command
execution respectively. The same call-out script is invoked for both events.

A "notify" event script is invoked to report the status of mdevctl's
command results. This may be used to signal external programs of changes
made to a mediated device, or simply to assist with debugging efforts.

A "get" event script is invoked for the define and list commands to acquire
device attributes from sysfs.

See `mdevctl --help` or the manpage for more information.
